   Continue (F5): Resume program execution until the next breakpoint.
   Step Over (F10): Execute the next line of code, stepping over function calls.
   Step Into (F11): Step into a function call to debug inside the called function.
   Step Out (Shift+F11): Step out of the current function, returning to the caller.
   Debug Console

   Execute arbitrary code in the context of the debug session.
   Print variable values or call functions to test and inspect behavior during debugging.
   Integrated Terminal

   Use the integrated terminal for input/output when debugging console applications.
   Open the terminal using Ctrl+ (backtick) and run commands within the context of the project.
   Example: Debugging a Python Program
   Write the Program:

   Create app.py with the following content:
   python
   Copy code
   def add(a, b):
    return a + b

   def main():
    result = add(2, 3)
    print(f'The result is {result}')

   if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
   Configure Debugging:

   Open the Debug view and click create a launch.json file.
   Choose Python as the environment.
   Set Breakpoints:

   Open app.py.
   Click to the left of line numbers to set breakpoints, e.g., on the line result = add(2, 3).
   Start Debugging:

   Select "Python: Current File" in the Debug view.
   Click the green play button or press F5.
   Debugging:

   When the program hits a breakpoint, use the Debug toolbar to step through the code, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions in the Debug Console.



10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

   Step-by-Step Process
   1. Installing Git
   Before integrating Git with VS Code, ensure Git is installed on your system:

   Download Git: Git Download Page
   Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
   2. Initializing a Repository
   Open VS Code: Launch VS Code and open the folder containing your project.
   Open Source Control View: Click the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or press Ctrl+Shift+G.
   Initialize Repository:
   Click Initialize Repository in the Source Control view.
   Alternatively, open the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS), type Git: Initialize Repository, and select it.
   Create a .gitignore File (optional but recommended):
   Create a .gitignore file in the root directory of your project.
   Add patterns to exclude files and directories from version control, e.g.:
   bash
   Copy code
   node_modules/
   *.log
   3. Making Commits
   Stage Changes:
   Changes to files are automatically detected and shown in the Source Control view under Changes.
   Click the + icon next to each file to stage changes, or click + next to Changes to stage all changes.
   Commit Changes:
   Enter a commit message in the message input box at the top of the Source Control view.
   Click the checkmark icon or press Ctrl+Enter (or Cmd+Enter on macOS) to commit the changes.
   4. Pushing Changes to GitHub
   Create a GitHub Repository:

   Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
   Copy the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/username/repo.git).
   Add Remote Repository:

   Open the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+P.
   Type Git: Add Remote and select it.
   Enter a name for the remote (commonly origin).
   Paste the GitHub repository URL and press Enter.
   Push Changes:

   Open the Source Control view.
   Click the ellipsis (three dots) icon at the top of the view and select Push.
   Alternatively, open the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+P, type Git: Push, and select it.
   Key Git Commands in VS Code
   Stage All Changes: Git: Stage All Changes
   Unstage All Changes: Git: Unstage All Changes
   Commit: Git: Commit
   Push: Git: Push
   Pull: Git: Pull
   View History: Git: View File History
